/**
 * Queue => Stack
 * -----------------------------
 * Queue a stack data structure.
 *
 * A queue is a data structure in which the first element is inserted from one end called
 * REAR (also called tail), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other
 * end called as FRONT (also called head).  This makes queue a FIFO (first in first out), or
 * the element that is inserted first will always be the first to be removed.
 *
 * @private {object} _storage              Default value should be an empty object.
 * @private {number} _size                 Default value should be set 0.
